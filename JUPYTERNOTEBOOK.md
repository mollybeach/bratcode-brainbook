# üìì Jupyter Notebook Study Guide with In-Depth Explanations

---


## üß± What is Jupyter Notebook?

* Jupyter is an open-source web-based IDE primarily used for data science, machine learning, and Python scripting.
* Supports interactive code execution, markdown notes, visualizations, and inline outputs.
* Originally based on the IPython kernel; "Jupyter" = Julia + Python + R.

---

## üßÆ Code Cells

```python
x = 5
print(x * 2)
```

* Code cells let you write and run Python code interactively.
* Shortcut: `Shift + Enter` to run a cell.

---

## üìù Markdown Cells

```markdown
# This is a heading
**Bold**, *italic*, `inline code`, and lists:
- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2
```

* Use Markdown cells to add titles, documentation, and LaTeX equations.
* Shortcut: `Esc` then `M` to change a cell to Markdown.

---

## üì¶ Installing Packages

```python
!pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

* The `!` allows shell commands from inside a code cell.
* Useful for installing packages dynamically inside notebooks.
* **Comparison**: Similar to `!` in Bash or `shell` magic in IPython.

---

## üìä Visualization Example

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 9, 16])
plt.title("Simple Plot")
plt.show()
```

* Plots render inline below the code cell.
* Use `%matplotlib inline` if using older Jupyter setups.

---

## üßµ Magic Commands

```python
%timeit sum(range(1000))   # Time execution
%lsmagic                   # List all magic commands
```

* `%` for line magics, `%%` for cell magics.
* Used for debugging, profiling, and system interaction.
* **Examples**:

  * `%run script.py`
  * `%%writefile test.py`
  * `%who` shows current variables

---

## üìÅ File I/O

```python
with open("example.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello from Jupyter!")
```

* Files can be read and written from within cells.
* The notebook‚Äôs working directory is where the `.ipynb` file is saved.

---

## üîÅ Loops and Interactivity

```python
from tqdm.notebook import tqdm

for i in tqdm(range(100)):
    pass
```

* Use `tqdm` for progress bars.
* Widgets: Add buttons, sliders with `ipywidgets`.

---

## üß™ Best Practices

* Keep cells short and readable.
* Use Markdown to explain logic and results.
* Restart the kernel and re-run all to ensure reproducibility.
* Organize your notebook top-down like a story.

---

## üîê Security and Sharing

* `.ipynb` files are JSON-formatted text and can be version-controlled via Git.
* Use Binder, nbviewer, or JupyterHub to share notebooks.
* Never store secrets (like API keys) directly in notebooks.

---

## üîß Extensions (JupyterLab)

* Use `jupyter lab` for a more powerful UI (tabs, terminals, file browsers).
* Install extensions like:

  * Variable Inspector
  * Table of Contents
  * Codefolding

---

## üß† History and Kernel

* Kernel = the Python process running your code.
* Interrupt with stop button or `Kernel > Interrupt`.
* Restart kernel to clear memory.
* **History**: Originated from the IPython project (2001), evolved into Jupyter in 2014.

---

## üìä Data Science Workflows

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
sns.pairplot(df)
plt.show()
```

* Use NumPy for arrays, pandas for tabular data, and seaborn for advanced visualization.
* Jupyter is ideal for EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).

---

## ü§ñ Deep Learning Workflows

```python
import torch
import tensorflow as tf

print(torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]))
print(tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]))
```

* Run PyTorch or TensorFlow inside notebooks for rapid prototyping.
* You can visualize model graphs, use TensorBoard, and debug layer-by-layer.

---

## ü§ù Collaborative Environments

* **Google Colab**: Free cloud-hosted Jupyter environment with GPU support.
* **JupyterHub**: Multi-user Jupyter server ideal for teams, classrooms.
* **Git**: Version control notebooks as `.ipynb` files (can view diffs via `nbdime`).
* Use GitHub + Binder to launch shareable, interactive notebooks.
